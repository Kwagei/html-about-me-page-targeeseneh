               <p>I was born through the union of Mr & Mrs <strong>Tanneh-Bartee Seneh</strong> in Ghana, on the 21 of November 2000. Started my primary education at the <strong>LIBERIA DUJAR HIGH SCHOOL</strong>
            where i remain until the complection of high schol.Coming up as a kid I've always had the dream of becoming a programmer but never had the opportunity at the moment. Upon graduation, I enrooled at the <strong>LIBERIA DUJAR UNIVERSITY COLLEGE</strong> where I study Procurement for two semester and left because I had an opportunity to study my dream career
            at the <strong>Kwagei Innovators Training</strong> where people with the vision of becoming a programmer are train to bring forth their dream of becoming a brillent programmer.

            <h4>My exprience with KIT</h4>
                <P>Enrooling at KIT was the greatest thing that has happen to me. At KIT I have experience a huge love from both the instructors and students. Togetherness and unity is one thing that lives within the entire KIT family.
                  KIT being a challenging institution that challange students and bring out the best in them, I learn within a short length of time how to work with HTML and it elements. We have a good and quite learning enviroment, stable internet system and instructors that know their work to the best of their abality.
                  KIT has a project base learning system that make you apply what you're learning in real life. You just need to be willing to put in your work.
